# Buying a house in the UK

Notes on buying a house as a first time buyer

# People involved

   1. Mortgage broker
      1. Often have access to better mortgage rates than individuals
      1. Sometimes are free sometimes come with a fee, e.g. aroud £500 is typical
      1. Worth speaking to some and determining if they make a net saving after paying their fee
   1. Solicitor / Conveyancer
      1. They do the checks on the property being bought
      1. They also act as intermediaries for both parties
      1. Total cost of checks, legal fees etc range from £1600 to £2000, shop around. I got quotes from 4 local to get this range.
      1. Would recommend a local company that you can speak to, rather than an online service, which is often a lot cheaper but can be slow and hard to speak to the same person dealing with your case.
   1. Estate agent
      1. Vendors typically sell their house via an estate agent
      1. The level of interaction with the vendor is quite low (initially at least)

All three people above need to be made aware of each other initially in the sale.

# Process of viewing & buying

   1. Search online for something you like
   1. Arrange viewings:
      1. A lot of estate agents or builders will ask you to go through financial verification before you can view
      1. This is often done using their specific mortgage advisor
      1. The checks are soft checks and do not affect your credit score (but ask them to be sure!)
      1. I took out a Decision In Principal with my bank before doing any viewing. In the end this was not really needed at this stage in the process. See DIP later
      1. The financial validation asks about emplyment, savings, deposit amount etc and they determine if the house you want to view is affordable. If so, then they green light the viewing
   1. View as many properites as you like, also arrange second viewings for ones that stand out
   1. Things to look out for:
      1. Exterior: check windows, guttering, walls for cracks or subsidence, gardens
      1. Interior: check windows inside, flooring, walls for large cracks/damp, doors, quality of kitchen/bathrooms
   1. Ask about:
      1. Date of last boiler change/service (if gas)
      1. Date of last rewiring/plumbing
      1. Was the property extended, if so, when and by house much? Were the foundations done for a single or double storey extension?
      1. Was the house on the market recently, if so for how long? How much interest was there in it? How many offers have been made?
      1. Any flood risks?
      1. Possible to convert attic (this you can check by looking at the neighbours on google maps)?
      1. Broadband speeds, school checks, adjacent house prices can all be done online (e.g. on rightmove)
   1. Making an offer:
      1. Initial offers are not legally binding
      1. Offer whatever you think is fair
      1. You may be out bid, rejected or accepted
   1. If an offer is accepted:
      1. At this point you need the decision in principal to show that the bank will lend you the money. The mortgage advisor can do this.
      1. For a DIP you need information about employment, salary, outstanding debt, property in other countries etc. All fairly standard and quite high level.
      1. They basically want to know what things will compete for your money with the mortgage. They don't need things like how much you spend or food etc.
      1. At this point you also need proof of identity, current address, salary, bankd statments and deposit.
   1. Get a solictor (this can actually be done before making an offer I suppose, I did it after the offer was accepted):
      1. Shop around locally, get a few quotes and pick the best one
      1. They will ask for some personal information and the details of the property
      1. A portion of the total costs (£300 or so) is paid initially to carry out the checks on the new house. The checks can take time, so best to not delay this step.
      1. I'M HERE ATM, ADD MORE INFO LATER
   1. Apply for the mortgage:
      1. The mortgage advisor will normally do all this for you using the information you've given them in the past.
      1. I'M HERE ATM, ADD MORE INFO LATER


# Key milestones

   1. Offer acceptance
   1. Mortgage application approval
   1. Agreed date of completion
   1. Exchange of contracts / paying deposit
   1. Completion of sale / getting deeds/keys

The longest time delay is often between offer acceptance and exchange. Completion typically happens a few days to 2 weeks after exchange.
